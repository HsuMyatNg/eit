                  <p class="lh-base">The first awardee was supposed to take a trip for CELTA at LEXIS in Brisbane, Australia, 
                    between May 21st ~ Sep 21, 2020. This award would not come up without an offer of support to
                     the awardee from Australians who have experiences of teaching in Myanmar. However, due to the outbreak of the pandemic, it has been postponed. When travel restrictions for the pandemic will be eased,
                     we plan to carry out this award (hopefully by Q4 2022).</p>
                  <p class="lh-base">Another awardee of 2021 is expected to take an online part-time CELTA course in Thailand in Q4 2021. However, it depends on 
                    the stability of Internet in Myanmar where Tatmadaw continues to disrupt or hinder or throttle
                     down Internet connections via telecoms for suppressing civilians' pro-democracy activities.</p>
